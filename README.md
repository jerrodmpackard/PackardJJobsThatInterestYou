Jobs That Interest You
Created a single page website in React using browser router and bootstrap to describe 5 jobs that interest me. Included is information about each position, why I want to work for each company, skills I need to learn to obtain each position, goals I would like to achieve in each position, and if I currently have the skills needed to be successful in each position. Also included are links to each company's website and to each individual job description.
Peer review: Zahid Afsar
Peer review comments: Website looks clean, I like the format and even the use of tabs for his sections of the jobs. Each description for the tabs is descriptive and well worded. Also it meets the requirements for the challenge. Everything works well, I couldn't break anything. One suggestion I would like to add is maybe adding alt tags to the background images. Great job!
