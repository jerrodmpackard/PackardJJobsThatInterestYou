                                <li>Cisco seems like it has a great culture. Throughout my research on these top five jobs, Cisco consistently came up as one of the best places to work, with some of the highest job satisfaction in the industry. That sounds like a place I want to dedicate my time to.</li>
                                <li>Cisco has some of the coolest benefits. With things like employee stock purchase programs, annual bonuses, and tuition reimbursement.</li>
                                <li>Cisco offers perks like birthdays off, anniversary prizes after your 1st year, 5th year, and every 5 years after that. They also have employee discounts and generous PTO and holidays.</li>
                                <li>For professional development, Cisco has this awesome time swap program, where you can swap 20% of your job with someone else to learn new skills while still meeting your responsibilities. They also have a job swap program, where you can fulfill your career aspirations by swapping 100% of your job with someone on a temporary or permanent basis. That sounds so cool and I would love the opportunity to take advantage of these programs.</li>
